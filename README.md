# CPP-Dog-Years
Dog years converter


<p>So a one-year-old dog is 10.5 years old in human years, and a two-year-old 
dog is 21 years old in humanyearsâ€¦ hmm this is about to get more complicated. 
Before I start doing the math in my head, let a computer take care of it!</p>

<p>I'll write a C++ program called dog_years.cpp to calculate the age, in human
years, of any dog older than 2. </p>
